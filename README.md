# RFID Attendance System

This repository contains the code for the GUI program of my RFID-based attendance system, implemented using Arduino Uno, RFID-RC522 module. The GUI implementation shown here was developed using Windows Forms framework, a popular GUI framework for C#. This was done as a class project during my senior year at NSU.
